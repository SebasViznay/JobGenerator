# JobGenerator
Process Synchronization Mechanisms  with Random Job Generation

The main objective was to implement and compare different mechanisms 
of mutual exclusion (Mutexes, Semaphores, and Peterson's Solution) to 
solve problems such as race and deadlocks conditions, while using a 
pre-emptive system to plan the execution of works. 

Programmed in Java, Iâ€™m going to simulate a workspace where physical 
jobs are happening, different office workers (users) are going to be 
randomly assigned either a printing or scanning job, which will have 
random number of pages and arrival times.
